# Project Overview

Founded in 2018, T4Tech is an e-commerce company specialising in popular electronics, now serving a global customer base. They sell products through their online site and mobile app, utilising marketing channels like email campaigns, SEO, and affiliate links. Their top-selling products include brands like Apple, Samsung, and ThinkPad. T4Tech leverages user data to gain insights that inform strategic decisions, helping them stay competitive in their niche.

The goal of this project is to investigate the overall sales trends and growth rates at T4Tech between 2019 and 2022, together with the performance of its loyalty program and refund rates. To evaluate the overall sales trends and growth rates, 3 metrics will be the focus: total sales revenue, order count and average order value (AOV). This will be leveraged to surface recommendations for the sales and marketing teams for future marketing campaigns and to assess whether T4Tech should continue its Loyalty Programme.

# Dataset Structure

The dataset consisted of four tables, including information about order dates & order values, customer acquision methods & loyalty program adoption rates, order delivery time & refund rates, and purchase location data.

# Executive Summary

•	Between 2019 and 2022, **T4Tech averaged 27k in sales volume and $7 million in sales revenue**. Notably, 2020 had the strongest growth in sales revenue and sales volumes, driven by increased demand for the MacBook Air Laptop and ThinkPad Laptop, which were essential for work from home setups during the pandemic. 

•	Initially, T4Tech's sales primarily came from non-loyalty program members. However, by 2022, **loyalty members became the main revenue source**, contributing an average of 55% to total revenue and sales volume. Therefore, T4Tech should continue using its loyalty program due its strong performance and growth.  

•	There is an opportunity for T4Tech to improve their post-pandemic sales performance by offering exclusive discounts, incentives and rewards on MacBook Air Laptops when purchased through the loyalty program. This could be effective because the MacBook Air is a top seller, **yet 90% of its revenue and volume come from non-loyalty members who, on average, spend 10% less than loyalty program members.**  
 

# Insights Deep-dive
## Yearly Summary and Growth Rates
•	On average, there were 27k sales each year, generating an average annual revenue of approximately $7 million, with the average order value standing at $260. 

•	The year 2021 recorded the peak in sales volume at 36k, whereas 2020 had the highest average order value at $300.

•	**The year 2020 experienced a significant growth rate in total sales, order count and AOV, achieving over twice the sales volume and total revenue compared to 2019.** 

•	Although 2021 saw an increase in the number of sales, the overall revenue declined as customers opted for items that were, on average, 15% less expensive than those purchased in 2020.

### Seasonality
•	Total sales revenue and volume typically experience the strongest growth during the holiday season (November to December) each year, with December experiencing around 20% growth on average.

•	Following this peak, both metrics see a sharp decline, indicating typical post-holiday spending patterns, with a subsequent recovery occurring between July and September.

•	On average, the most significant drops in sales revenue and volume are observed in February (-23%) and October (-35%) each year, showing that **T4Tech's customers typically withhold spending in anticipation of summer and holiday season sales promotions.** 


## Regional Performance
•	In all regions, 2020 saw the highest growth rate in total sales, nearly doubling both sales numbers and revenue compared to 2019, indicating growth was driven by a global macroeconomic factor, which was the Covid-19 pandemic. Total sales revenue and volumes in March 2020 were approximately 50% higher than in February 2020, coinciding with the pandemic’s onset. 

•	In 2022, total sales revenue and volumes declined sharply in all regions by approximately 50% and 40%, respectively, due to a macroeconomic factor which was the global semiconductor chip shortage. **As semiconductor chips are essential for all T4Tech products, this global shortage led to severe supply constraints despite high demand.**

•	The LATAM and APAC regions show significantly lower total sales revenue and volumes compared to other regions, **despite comparable average order values.** 

•	Furthermore, the APAC region boasts the highest AOV among all regions, indicating that consumers in this market likely perceive T4Tech's products as premium offerings. This perception positions T4Tech as less accessible in a market largely dominated by more affordable alternatives from competitors.

## Key Product Performance
### Macro-level product trends
•	In 2020, total sales revenue and volumes for all products saw a significant increase, **with the MacBook Air achieving over four times the sales revenue and volumes compared to 2019, while the ThinkPad laptop experienced more than a threefold increase.** The onset of the pandemic drove demand for these products as students and corporate employees sought them for their work-from-home setups.

•	In 2022, **all products experienced a sharp decline in total sales revenue and volumes**, underscoring the impact of **supply constraints from the global semiconductor chip shortage**, despite strong demand.

### Best and worst performing products
•	The 27-inch gaming monitor (36% contribution), Apple AirPods (29% contribution), and MacBook Air (20% contribution) are consistently the top three products in terms of total revenue contribution. For total order count, the best performers are the Apple AirPods (45% contribution) , 27-inch gaming monitor (22% contribution) , and Samsung charging cable (21% contribution).

•	**The Samsung charging cable has a high order count but low revenue contribution due to many zero-dollar sales**, indicating it may be given away as a complimentary accessory or that transaction values are not accurately recorded. This issue should be discussed with the data management and sales teams.

•	Conversely, the Bose SoundSport headphones, Apple iPhone, and Samsung webcam are the three worst performers in revenue contribution. The Samsung webcam, despite strong initial sales, has seen a steady decline. The Bose SoundSport headphones are underperforming in sales volume and revenue, averaging the third-lowest purchase price ($124) , suggesting a need for re-evaluation of its shelf presence. **All three are also the lowest in order volume.**

•	The MacBook Air ($1588) , ThinkPad laptop ($1100) , and Apple iPhone ($740) consistently have the highest average sales values. **While the Apple iPhone boasts a high average order value, it does not perform well in order count or total revenue contribution.** This indicates a potential opportunity for growth in iPhone sales through financing options or bundling with other products, as T4Tech's customers may see it as an expensive product with limited appeal compared to other products

## Loyalty Program Performance
•	In 2019, non-loyalty members drove around 90% of sales revenue and volume, with higher average spending ($232) compared to loyalty members ($185).

•	By 2020, loyalty program performance improved, contributing 30% of sales revenue and 37% of volume. Loyalty members’ average spending rose to $225 but remained below the $344 average for non-loyalty members.

•	In 2021 and early 2022, loyalty members became the primary revenue source, averaging 55% of total revenue and volume. In 2022, loyalty members spent more per purchase ($240) than non-loyalty members ($215).

•	In Q4 2022, non-loyalty members contributed over 60% of total sales revenue and volume, suggesting reduced effectiveness of the loyalty program in driving sales during that period

•	**The MacBook Air is a top seller, yet 90% of its revenue and volume come from non-loyalty members**, who have had 10% lower order values. This suggests potential revenue growth through loyalty program engagement.

## Refund Rate Trends
•	Refunds peaked in 2020 with a 9.2% rate, likely as customers tested new brands and products for remote work setups but regretted some purchases. In that year, the MacBook Air and ThinkPad laptop had the highest refund rates at 17% each.

•	Apple AirPods were the most refunded product in 2020, with 1,5k returns. Apple products made up 60% of that year's 3.1k refunds. 

•	Over the entire period, the MacBook Air and ThinkPad laptops had the highest refund rates at 11% and 12%, potentially due to defects.

•	Refund rates dropped sharply after 2020, falling to 3.6% in 2021 and 0% in 2022, **reflecting significant improvements in T4Tech's quality control.**

# Recommendations

Given these insights, T4Tech should consider the following recommendations:

### Leverage the loyalty program to drive seasonal promotions:


•	**Peak Season:** Offer exclusive seasonal perks to loyalty program members, such as free shipping during peak seasons (November-December), to incentivise joining the loyalty program. 

•	**Off-Peak Season:** During slower months like February and October, reward loyalty members with double points, cashback, and additional discounts for referring other customers to join the loyalty program. This referral incentive will expand the loyalty program's customer base ahead of peak spending periods, ultimately strengthening revenue. 

### Improve product accessibility in the APAC and LATAM Regions:


•	Refine the product range in the APAC and LATAM regions by incorporating more accessible local brands identified through a market demand study, such as Huawei, HP, and Xiaomi. 

•	Offer flexible financing and bundling options for premium products like the MacBook Air to make them more attainable and appealing to consumers in these regions


### Re-evaluate T4Tech's product line-up:

**•	Bose SoundSport Headphones:** Consider removal or replacement due to consistently poor sales performance

**•	Samsung Webcam:** Bundle it with complementary products like the MacBook Air or ThinkPad Laptop, positioning it as an essential work-from-home add-on.

**•	Apple iPhone:** To address the disconnect from other products in T4Tech's line-up, future marketing campaigns should highlight its seamless integration with the MacBook Air and Airpods to stimulate sales through bundled purchases. 

### Use the MacBook Air Laptop to stimulate loyalty program growth: 

•	Offer exclusive discounts and limited promotions on MacBook Air laptops and their accessories when purchased through the Loyalty Program
